The project is titled - Clean Energy.
For this project, we are given some datasets of Solar Power plants,
we are expected to develop a model which can understand some factors
like power consumption, and production.

With the aim to overall analyze the data and try to find the relation between:
1. Time
2. Power
3. Daily Yield
and more.
